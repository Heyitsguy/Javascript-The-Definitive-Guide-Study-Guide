# Chapter 2 Lexical Structure #
* Lexical structure is basically the rules of a particular language
that you have to follow to write code that can be interpreted.

* Javascript is case sensitive while HTML is not, but since
there is overlap between javascript and XHTML, its important
to make XHTML case sensitive.

* Unicode escapes (`\u....`) can be used to display some Unicode
characters like vowels with tildes.

* `//` are single line comments, while `/* comment here */`
are used for multiline comments.

* A *literals* is a data value that appears directly in
a program. Examples of which are:
  * **String Literal** `"hi, im a string"`.
  * **Array Literals** `[Andy, Bill, 32, 20]` (Array Initializer)
  * **Object Literals** `{car:red, bike:maroon}`(Object initializer)
  * **Numbers**
  * **Booleans**
